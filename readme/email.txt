Hi Mao,

Thank you for submitting your application!

In order for both of us to get a feel of what it is like to work
together, we would like for you to try a practical exercise of visualising some data.

We are therefore giving you a homework assignment, which goes as follows:

1. Create a repository on Bitbucket or Github.
2. Using the attached JSON file we provide to you, use either D3 or
Highcharts to create an interactive visualisation that you think best
communicates the data in the JSON file. Bonus points for using AngularJS
for putting it all together. We will be mainly be looking at the
Javascript, but HTML and CSS are important too.
3. As you develop your visualisation, make sure you commit all your
changes to the online repo you created. We pay attention to the pragmatic
nature of your commits.
4. When you¡¯re done and ready to show us your work, let us know. However,
the deadline is 15th January, 2015.

Looking forward to viewing what you¡¯ve put together!

With Kind Regards,
Lauri Jalonen
